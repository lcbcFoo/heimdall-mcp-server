### Step 7: Validation and Testing
**Status**: ✅ PARTIALLY COMPLETED - Core Functionality Validated
**Date Range**: 2025-06-24 - 2025-06-24

#### Tasks Completed
- ✅ **Fixed Shared Data Architecture**: Resolved port conflict by removing legacy `.heimdall-mcp/` directory that was using old per-project ports (7177) instead of standardized port 6333
- ✅ **Implemented Shared Data Storage**: Added cross-platform shared directory support using `platformdirs` with proper OS conventions (`~/.local/share/heimdall/` on Linux)
- ✅ **Tested Core Cognitive Commands**:
  - `heimdall status --json` ✅ Working (shows memory counts)
  - `heimdall store "text"` ✅ Working (stores to L2 episodic)
  - `heimdall recall "query"` ✅ Working (retrieves with core/bridge categorization)
- ✅ **Tested Service Management Commands**:
  - `heimdall qdrant start` ✅ Working (uses shared directory `/home/foo/.local/share/heimdall/qdrant/`)
  - `heimdall qdrant stop` ✅ Working
  - `heimdall qdrant status` ✅ Working
  - `heimdall qdrant logs` ✅ Working
- ✅ **Tested Project Management Commands**:
  - `heimdall project init` ✅ Working (creates project-scoped collections in shared Qdrant)
  - `heimdall project list` ✅ Working (requires Qdrant running)
- ✅ **Tested Monitoring Commands**:
  - `heimdall monitor status` ✅ Working (shows service stopped state)
- ✅ **Tested Health Commands**:
  - `heimdall doctor` ✅ Working (validates shared directories, models, performance)
- ✅ **Fixed Configuration Issues**: Updated `EmbeddingConfig.from_env()` to use function call instead of non-existent class attribute

#### Validation Results

**✅ WORKING COMMANDS (11/16 tested):**
1. `heimdall status` - System status with memory counts
2. `heimdall store` - Experience storage (works without `--context` parameter)
3. `heimdall recall` - Memory retrieval with categorization
4. `heimdall qdrant start/stop/status/logs` - Service lifecycle management
5. `heimdall project init` - Project initialization with collection creation
6. `heimdall project list` - Project listing (when Qdrant running)
7. `heimdall monitor status` - Monitoring service status
8. `heimdall doctor` - Health validation with shared directory support

**🔍 PARTIALLY TESTED:**
- `heimdall store --context` - JSON parsing issue with context parameter (workaround: use without context)

**⚠️ NOT YET TESTED:**
- `heimdall load` - File/directory memory loading
- `heimdall git-load` - Git pattern loading
- `heimdall shell` - Interactive shell access
- `heimdall-mcp` - Standalone MCP server
- `heimdall monitor start/stop/restart/health` - Full monitoring lifecycle

#### Key Architectural Validations

**✅ Shared Data Storage Working:**
- Qdrant data: `/home/foo/.local/share/heimdall/qdrant/` (contains collections, aliases, raft_state.json)
- Models: `/home/foo/.local/share/heimdall/models/` (directory created, ready for future model downloads)
- Config: `~/.local/share/heimdall/` follows XDG Base Directory specification

**✅ Operations Layer Integration:**
- All tested commands successfully use `CognitiveOperations` class
- Rich terminal formatting working correctly
- JSON output support functional
- Error handling graceful

**✅ Service Management:**
- Docker compose correctly uses bind mount to shared directory
- Legacy container cleanup working (removed old per-project containers)
- Standardized port 6333 usage confirmed
- Health checks validate shared directories instead of legacy `./data/` paths

#### Issues Discovered & Resolved

1. **Port Conflict**: Legacy `.heimdall-mcp/docker-compose.yml` was using port 7177 instead of 6333
   - **Resolution**: Removed legacy directory, system now uses standardized shared architecture

2. **Configuration Error**: `EmbeddingConfig.model_cache_dir` field factory not working with `cls.model_cache_dir` access
   - **Resolution**: Updated `from_env()` method to call `_get_default_model_cache_dir()` function directly

3. **Health Check False Positive**: Data directories check was looking for legacy `./data/` paths
   - **Resolution**: Updated health checker to validate shared directories (`~/.local/share/heimdall/`)

#### Current Work
- ⚠️ **Remaining validation needed**: `load`, `git-load`, `shell`, `heimdall-mcp`, full monitoring lifecycle
- ⚠️ **Store command context issue**: JSON parsing error with `--context` parameter (minor)
- ✅ **Core unified CLI architecture validated and working**

## Technical Notes

### Key Architecture Changes
- **Operations-First Design**: Single `CognitiveOperations` class containing all business logic
- **Clean Interface Separation**: CLI, MCP, and Interactive interfaces consume operations layer
- **Dual Entry Points**: `heimdall` for terminal use, `heimdall-mcp` for AI clients
- **Data-First APIs**: All operations return structured dictionaries, interfaces format appropriately

### Operations Layer Interface Design
```python
class CognitiveOperations:
    def store_experience(self, text: str, context: dict = None) -> dict
    def retrieve_memories(self, query: str, types: list = None, limit: int = 10) -> dict
    def get_system_status(self, detailed: bool = False) -> dict
    def consolidate_memories(self, dry_run: bool = False) -> dict
    def load_memories(self, source_path: str, **kwargs) -> dict
    def load_git_patterns(self, repo_path: str, **kwargs) -> dict
```

### Directory Structure Changes
```
Current: memory_system/ + interfaces/
Target:  heimdall/ (unified)
         ├── cli.py (terminal interface)
         ├── operations.py (business logic)
         ├── mcp_server.py (AI interface)
         ├── interactive_shell.py (rich UI)
         ├── service_manager.py (infrastructure)
         └── monitoring_service.py (file monitoring)
```

## Dependencies
- **Internal**: All core cognitive_memory modules (encoding, storage, retrieval)
- **External**: typer (CLI), rich (formatting), mcp (protocol)
- **Blocking**: None - can proceed immediately
- **Blocked by**: None

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk: Import dependency issues during restructure
**Mitigation**: Update imports systematically using IDE refactoring tools, test after each phase

### Risk: Loss of functionality during consolidation
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing at each phase, maintain feature parity validation checklist

### Risk: MCP compatibility issues with new operations layer
**Mitigation**: Test MCP server thoroughly with Claude Code, Cline, and Continue clients

### Risk: Interactive shell regression
**Mitigation**: Preserve rich formatting capabilities, test all interactive commands

## Resources
- [Unified CLI Architecture Document](../arch-docs/unified-cli-architecture.md)
- Current implementations: `memory_system/cli.py`, `interfaces/cli.py`, `interfaces/mcp_server.py`
- Target interfaces: Terminal CLI, MCP Protocol, Interactive Shell
- Operations layer pattern: Clean Architecture, Dependency Inversion

## Summary

### Phase 1 Achievements
✅ **Operations Layer Complete** - Successfully extracted pure business logic from existing CLI implementations into a single, clean operations layer. This provides:

- **Single Source of Truth**: All cognitive operations centralized in `heimdall/operations.py`
- **Interface Independence**: No formatting or printing dependencies - returns structured data
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All existing CLI functionality preserved and enhanced
- **Clean Architecture**: Data-first design enabling multiple interface types
- **Robust Testing**: 36 unit tests covering all operations and edge cases

### Files Created
- `heimdall/operations.py` - Pure operations layer with `CognitiveOperations` class
- `heimdall/__init__.py` - Package initialization
- `tests/unit/heimdall/test_operations.py` - Comprehensive unit test suite

### Architecture Benefits
The operations layer enables clean separation between business logic and interface formatting, making it easy to add new interfaces (CLI, MCP, HTTP, gRPC) that consume the same operations but format data appropriately for their consumers.

### Next Steps
Ready to proceed to Phase 2: Enhance Unified CLI to consume the operations layer and provide terminal-specific formatting.

## Change Log
